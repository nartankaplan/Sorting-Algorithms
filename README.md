In order to make a comprehensive comparison and make the graph it is possible to narrow the array 
sizes and make a better inference.

COMPARISON and CONCLUSION


As it easily can be seen on the graph, Selection Sort takes too much time compared with Merge and Heap Sort algorithms while sorting large sized arrays. Also selection sort is inferior in terms of performance compared to the other two algorithms. On the other hand, Heap and Merge Sort algorithms has a small diffrences between eachother. Both algorithms have O(n log n) complexities, but the difference occurs since Merge Sort uses extra memory because it creates new subarrays and merges them during the sorting process. However, Heap sort would be more efficient in terms of extra memory usage, because it only converts the data into heap structure.

Best Performing: Merge Sort
